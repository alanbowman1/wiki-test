# List of design principles for documents and web sites 

## Don't Make Me Think (Steve Krug)
**The more important something is, the more prominent it is.**  
The most important elements are either larger, bolder, in a distinctive color, set off by more white space, or nearer the top of the page - or some combination of the above 

**Things that are related logically are related visually.**  
For instance, you can show that things are similar by grouping them together under a heading, displaying them in the same visual style, or putting them all in a clearly defined area. 

**Things are "nested" visually to show what's part of what.**
For instance, a site section name (Computer Books) would appear above the title for the individual books, reflecting the fact that the books are part of the section. And each book title in turn would span all the elements that make up the description of the book. 

## The Non-Designers Design Book (Robin Williams)
**Contrast**  
The idea behind contrast is to avoid elements on the page that are merely similar. If the elements (type, color, size, line thickness, shape, space, etc.) are not the same, make them **very different**. Contrast is often the most important visual attraction on the page - it's what makes a reader look at the page in the first place. 

**Repetition**  
Repeat visual elements of the design throughout the piece. You can repeat colors, shapes, textures, spatial relationships, line thicknesses, fonts, sizes, graphic concepts, etc. This develops the organization and strengthens the unity. 

**Alignment**   
Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have some visual connection with another element on the page. This create a clean, sophisticated, fresh look.   
**Proximity** 
Items relating to each other should be grouped close together. When several items are in close proximity to each other, they become one visual unit rather than several separate units. This helps organize information, reduces clutter, and gives the reader a clear structure. 

## Designing Visual Language (Kostelnic and Roberts) 
**Arrangement**   
Arrangement means order, the organization of visual elements so that readers can see their structure - how they cohere in groups, how they differ from one another, how they create layers and hierarchies. 
Visual arrangement also involves spatial organization within a field, as in left and right, up and down. Arrangement also governs the organization of the text itself. 

**Emphasis**   
Emphasis is about controlling what stands out. Emphasis is the headers on a page, the logo, buttons on a screen, contrast. 

**Clarity**   
Clarity strategies help the receiver to decode the message, to understand it quickly and completely, and when necessary to react without ambivalence. Clarity strategies span the whole gamut of visual language, everything from typefaces to charts to illustrations. 

**Conciseness**  
Conciseness refers to the visual bulk and intricacy of the design - for example, the number of headings and lists, lines and boxes, colors and gray scales, the detail of the drawings, etc. Conciseness means generating designs that are appropriately succinct with a particular situation. Conciseness decisions are complicated because they involve trade-offs or balancing acts with the other cognate strategies. Everything there is there for a reason - everything serves the rhetorical purpose

**Tone**  
Tone refers to how your communications tone of voice comes across to the reader - serious, humorous, excited, formal, technical, etc. Is the information friendly and nontechnical, or serious and formal? Is it bold and dramatic to hold the viewers attention or reserved and matter-of-fact? 

**Ethos**  
Ethos establishes a trusting relationship with the listener or reader. The sender (writer) needs to cultivate a sense of character or credibility that will appeal to the audience. Visual language also needs to build trust if it is going to respond adequately to the rhetorical situation. Things like presenting the information objectively or if needed authoritatively help build ethos. 

## Basic Design Principles (from Basic Technical Communication continuing education course at KSU)
**Grouping and Separation**  
Grouping and Separation of elements governs the movement of the eyes from one part of a design to another. 
Items related to each other are grouped close together, as they are viewed as one visual element. This guides the reader to each visual element according to its importance. The eyes are then directed throughout the page by the careful placement of text, illustrations, or borders within the design. 

**Balance and Alignment**  
Balance and Alignment are used to create a symmertical and properly positioned layout. Used together, they ensure a clean, refined, and original look to your layout. Individually, each concept is defined as:
* Balance - the result of arranging one or more elements in the design so that visually they provide stability and rest for the eye. Creating a balance is often dependent on your piece. 
* Alignment - the apparence that elements on a page have a visual connection with another element on the page. This creates a strong tie from page to page. 

**Harmony and Repetition**  
Harmony and Repetition unify the appearance of your layout. Together they enable you to develop the organization and the unity of your piece. Individually, each concept is defined as:
* Harmony - the unity of all parts in the design. A layout can contain harmony of shape, tone, color, and treatment. 
* Repetition - the act of reiterating design elements (such as logos, boxes, rules, graphics, etc.) from page to page to unify the appearance of your document. 

**Contrast and Variety**  
Contrast and variety work uniquely together as they create interest in the final product by providing a variety in the design. That seems contradicting, however it provides a visual stimulation and prevents reader boredom. Together, this principle is possibly the most important visual attraction to a page, creating reader interest and enhancing the overall design. 

This principle is also an easy design to learn, however, be careful not to contrast everything in your design. This could result in confusion of what is important. 

To emphasize your layout, try to use a strong contrast between elements. Then strengthen your page by using a variety of subtle changes in the size, shape, and color of the design elements. 

Everything in a document is a design element, and contrast is the most important of all the design principles.
